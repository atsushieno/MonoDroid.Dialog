MonoDroid.Dialog
================

Forked from spouliot/MonoDroid.Dialog for use by Xamarin QA.

NOTE: This project is an attempt to port the ideas and ease of use of the 
MonoTouch.Dialog project to MonoDroid.  Given the significant differences 
in the layout and UI architectures between iOS and Android some things will 
inevitably be different between the projects but conceptually MonoDroid.Dialog 
should stay very close to MonoTouch.Dialog. Expect lots of changes and 
chaos as more and more elements get added.

MonoDroid.Dialog is a foundation to create dialog boxes and show table-based 
information without having to write dozens of delegates and controllers for 
the user interface.
